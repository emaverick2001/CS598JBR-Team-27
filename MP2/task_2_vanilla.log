2. `test_sum_elements_empty_list`: Tests the function with an empty list. The sum should be 0.
3. `test_sum_elements_negative_numbers`: Tests the function with a list of negative numbers. The sum should be -210.

Please replace `your_module` with the actual name of the module where the `is_prime` function is defined.

This test suite checks the `is_prime` function with a variety of inputs to ensure it behaves as expected. It tests for numbers from 0 to 20, which are the first 20 prime numbers.

        if balance < 0:
            return True

```

In this test suite, we have three tests:

1. `test_balance_check_with_positive_balance`: This test checks if the function returns `False` when the balance is positive.
2. `test_balance_check_with_negative_balance`: This test checks if the function returns `True` when the balance is negative.
3. `test_balance_check_with_zero_balance`: This test checks if the function returns `False` when the balance is zero.

Please note that you need to define the `balance_check` function in your test file or in the same file where you are running the tests.
