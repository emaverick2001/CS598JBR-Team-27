If the output is not as expected, the test will fail.\n","\n","The tests use `assert` to check if the output of `reverse_delete` is as expected. If the output is not as expected, the test will fail.\n","\n","The tests use `pytest.approx` to compare floats. If the two floats are approximately equal (within a small tolerance), the test will pass.\n","\n","The tests use `with pytest.raises(Exception)` to check if a certain exception is raised when calling a function. If the exception is not raised, the test will fail.\n","\n","The tests use `pytest.mark.parametrize` to run the same test with different inputs. This is useful for reducing code duplication and making the tests more readable.\n","\n","The tests use `is True` and `is False` to check if a value is True or False.
